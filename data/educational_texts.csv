Python Programming,"python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. it supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
guido van rossum began working on python in the late 1980s as a successor to the abc programming language. python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. beginning with python 3.5, capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing. as of 2025, the python software foundation supports python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14, following the project's annual release cycle and five-year support policy. earlier versions in the 3.x series have reached end-of-life and no longer receive security updates.

Neural Networks,"in machine learning, a neural network or neural net (nn), also called artificial neural network (ann), is a computational model inspired by the structure and functions of biological neural networks.
a neural network consists of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in the brain. artificial neuron models that mimic biological neurons more closely have also been recently investigated and shown to significantly improve performance. these are connected by edges, which model the synapses in the brain. each artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons. the ""signal"" is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the totality of its inputs, called the activation function. the strength of the signal at each connection is determined by a weight, which adjusts during the learning process.
typically, neurons are aggregated into la",154
Data Science,"data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data. 
data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine). data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.
data science is ""a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. it uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. however, data science is different from computer science and information science. turing award winner jim gra",135
Artificial Intelligence,"artificial intelligence (ai) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.
high-profile applications of ai include advanced web search engines (e.g., google search); recommendation systems (used by youtube, amazon, and netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., google assistant, siri, and alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and ai art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and go). however, many ai applications are not perceived as ai: ""a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications, often without being calle",142
